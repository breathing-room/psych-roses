        <p class=''>Life is a dying art.</p>
        <p class=''>Full of complexity, dark musings, whimsy, and rib pokes at redemption, Tasche and The Psychedelic Roses' new album escorts us on a tour of our most secret selves - the voices inside of our heads and the axes we long to grind. It lifts us when we feel heavy, colors us boldly when we wash out to grey, and throws a glorious gauntlet down that ... well, if we can't escape suffering completely, then what's the harm in finding a way to enjoy it just a little?
    The vocals, rich harmonies and strange siren calls, tap on the glass as we sit inside of ourselves, staring out; wakey wakey. Together with the sometimes raw and sometimes delicate instrumentals, the songs pick up our hearts, carefully shaking and rolling them onto the table as life's eternal game of craps continues.</p>
        <p class=''>We are in good hands as we move through it all.</p>
        <p class=''>In The Abyss, there's always a party in progress, with Tasche and The Psychedelic Roses taking the stage.</p>
